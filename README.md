# **Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declaration**

# **Problem Statement**

The frequency and intensity of natural disasters in the United States pose significant challenges to emergency management and resource distribution. This project visualizes historical disaster declaration data to identify geographic hotspots, temporal trends, and high-impact incident types to support better disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

# **Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of 68,542 records detailing federal disaster declarations in the US from 1953 to 2024 consisting total column of 24.

# **Tools Used**

**Power BI:** Used for data visualization and basic cleaning. It serves as the front-end tool to transform processed data into interactive maps, charts, and slicers.

**Google Colab:** Used as the primary environment for data cleaning. Python (Pandas) scripts were executed in Colab to handle missing values, clean strings, and format the dates before exporting the final CSV for visualization.

**VS Code:** The primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write and run the Jupyter Notebooks and manage project documentation.

**Git:** Employed for version control to track changes in the data cleaning scripts and the README file.

**GitHub:** Used to store, manage, and share the project repository, ensuring the analysis is accessible and reproducible.
